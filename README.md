# Topological analysis of U.S. city demographics

Analyzing city demographics with topological data analysis, by J. Kauba and T. Weighill. See our preprint [here](https://uncg-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/t_weighill_uncg_edu/EbQk0rtbhclIl8hx3Y6jdmUBw6unXVYqwlzlOZ8hffDHNw?e=jKvrOG). 

The analysis in the paper can be reproduced with two notebooks: 
- `Wasserstein-city-analysis.ipynb`: MDS plots, outlier analysis, change over time
- `Wasserstein-k-means.ipynb`: k++ means clustering

Plots of individual persistence diagrams and maps can be performed using `plot-maps-and-pds.ipynb`.
